While the unrest so far has only involved a relatively small number of people
in states including Minnesota, Michigan, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Florida, it
comes as the US president has raised expectations for a lifting of restrictions
while the US death toll from the pandemic nears 35,000.

Mr Trump took to Twitter to support the protests on Friday, a day after he
backed away from claims that he had “total” authority to reopen the economy and
said state governors should make such decisions, based on his guidelines.

“LIBERATE MINNESOTA,” he wrote, before adding, “LIBERATE MICHIGAN”, referring
in both cases to Midwestern states where protesters have taken aim at
restrictions ordered by Democratic governors.
