Facebook has released a map showing the proportion of people who say they have
experienced coronavirus symptoms in each state in the US. The data was gathered
from more than one million Facebook users who filled in a survey created by
Carnegie Mellon University about whether they were experiencing symptoms like a
cough or a fever. The map, which goes down to county level, will be updated
every day. Facebook says it will create similar maps for other countries in the
coming days and weeks, also based on survey responses.

Obviously, the map is only as good as the data that’s used to create it, and as
you can see for yourself, vast swaths of the map don’t have enough participants
to yield reliable data. The map is part of Facebook’s work with CMU and the CDC
to predict the coronavirus’s spread.
