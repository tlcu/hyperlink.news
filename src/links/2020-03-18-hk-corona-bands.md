Starting at midnight on Mar. 19, Hong Kong will put all arriving passengers
under a two-week quarantine and medical surveillance in an attempt to prevent
more spread of the COVID-19 disease.

Hong Kong’s government begun requiring the use of an electronic wristband,
accompanied by a smartphone app, in an effort to enforce the self-quarantine
measures.

One passenger told CNBC, “I felt a bit weird about the bracelet-checking thing
because of privacy reasons, but I understand why they have to do that.”
