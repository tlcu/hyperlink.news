Germany changed course on Sunday over which type of smartphone technology it
wanted to use to trace coronavirus infections , backing an approach supported
by Apple and Google along with a growing number of other European countries.

Countries are rushing to develop apps to give a detailed picture of the risk of
catching the coronavirus, as the chain of infection is proving hard to break
because it can be spread by those showing no symptoms.

Chancellery Minister Helge Braun and Health Minister Jens Spahn said in a joint
statement that Berlin would adopt a “decentralised” approach to digital contact
tracing, thus abandoning a home-grown alternative that would have given health
authorities central control over tracing data.

In Europe, most countries have chosen short-range Bluetooth “handshakes”
between mobile devices as the best way of registering a potential contact, even
though it does not provide location data.

But they have disagreed about whether to log such contacts on individual
devices or on a central server – which would be more directly useful to
existing contact tracing teams that work phones and knock on doors to warn
those who may be at risk.
