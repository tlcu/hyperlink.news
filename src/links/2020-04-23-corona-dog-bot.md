## Boston Dynamics: Using Mobile Robots To Protect Healthcare Workers

Starting in early March, Boston Dynamics started receiving inquiries from
hospitals asking if our robots could help minimize their staff’s exposure to
COVID-19. One of the hospitals that we spoke to shared that, within a week, a
sixth of their staff had contracted COVID-19 and that they were looking into
using robots to take more of their staff out of range of the novel virus.

Based on these conversations, as well as the global shortage of critical
personal protective equipment (PPE), we have spent the past several weeks
trying to better understand hospital requirements to develop a mobile robotics
solution with our robot, Spot. The result is a legged robot application that
can be deployed to support frontline staff responding to the pandemic in ad-hoc
environments such as triage tents and parking lots.

Today marks the second week of Spot’s presence at a local Boston facility,
Brigham and Women’s Hospital, where the medical team uses the robot as a mobile
telemedicine platform, allowing healthcare providers to remotely triage
patients. We’re listening to their feedback on how Spot can do more but are
encouraged by reports that using the robot has helped their nursing staff
minimize time exposed to potentially contagious patients.
