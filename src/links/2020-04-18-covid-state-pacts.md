“This is mayhem,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. “We need a
coordinated approach between the federal government and the states.”

In the absence of one, Cuomo and sixteen other governors representing half the
nation’s population have organized three separate clusters of states each
committed to working together on the details of relaunching businesses, schools
and events while avoiding a resurgence of infections.

The pacts have formed among states mostly with Democratic governors on the West
Coast, around the Great Lakes and in the densely populated Northeast, covering
several big metropolitan areas that cross state lines, including New York,
Chicago and Philadelphia.

Others are going their own way, including the second most populous state —
Texas — where Gov. Greg Abbott said Friday that he would ease some
pandemic-related restrictions next week. Florida, another state with a huge
population, is also not in an alliance.

California, Oregon and Washington state have teamed up, and pacts have formed
among Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania
and Rhode Island as well as Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota,
Ohio and Wisconsin.
