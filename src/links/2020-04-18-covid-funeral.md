Dealing a major blow to the ban on mass gatherings to curb the spread of
coronavirus, tens of thousands surged to the funeral prayers for a leader of an
Islamist party in Brahmanbaria yesterday.

As many as 100,000 people flocked to the namaz-e-janaza of Maulana Jubayer
Ahmed Ansari, a senior nayeb-e-ameer of Bangladesh Khelafat Majlish, in the
east central districtâ€™s Sarail upazila.

The incident not only raises concerns about the risks of contagion, but also
throws up questions about the role of the authorities, especially the law
enforcers, who have been constantly maintaining that strict measures were in
place across the country to ensure social distancing.
