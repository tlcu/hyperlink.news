The global economy is expected to contract by 3 percent in 2020 as a result of
the coronavirus pandemic, the International Monetary Fund predicted in its
annual World Economic Outlook released Tuesday.

"It is very likely that this year the global economy will experience its worst
recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global
financial crisis a decade ago," IMF Economic Counsellor Gita Gopinath wrote in
the report. "The Great Lockdown, as one might call it, is projected to shrink
global growth dramatically."
