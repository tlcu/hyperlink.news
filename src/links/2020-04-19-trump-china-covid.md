Donald Trump has warned that China should face consequences if it was
“knowingly responsible” for the coronavirus pandemic, as deaths in Europe from
Covid-19 approached 100,000.

“It could have been stopped in China before it started and it wasn’t, and the
whole world is suffering because of it,” Trump said in his daily White House
briefing, as US cases topped 730,000 and fatalities in the country approached
39,000.

“If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake. But if they were knowingly
responsible, yeah, I mean, then sure there should be consequences,” Trump said.
He did not elaborate on what form that might take.

He said the Chinese were “embarrassed” and the question now was whether what
happened with the coronavirus was “a mistake that got out of control, or was it
done deliberately?”

“There’s a big difference between those two,” he said.
