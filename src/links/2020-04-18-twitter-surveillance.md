Twitter Inc will not be able to reveal surveillance requests it received from
the U.S. government after a federal judge accepted government arguments that
this was likely to harm national security after a near six-year long legal
battle.

The social media company had sued the U.S. Department of Justice in 2014 to be
allowed to reveal, as part of its “Draft Transparency Report”, the surveillance
requests it received. It argued its free-speech rights were being violated by
not being allowed to reveal the details.

The judge ruled on Friday that granting Twitter’s request “would be likely to
lead to grave or imminent harm to the national security.”
