Baishazhou market, the biggest wholesale wet market in Wuhan, is buzzing again
this week after the city's lockdown was lifted on April 8. All those entering
the market must have their temperatures tested and show market inspectors their
green code, which suggests the user is symptom-free.

The market stayed open during the past two months, striving to keep normal
operation of the city, which was struggling with the coronavirus. "If
Baishazhou were closed, there would be no food for Wuhan people," manager of
the market, surnamed Zheng, told the Global Times.
