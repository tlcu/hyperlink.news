This week a clinical team in Boston has reported being able to monitor a
COVID-19 patient remotely, thanks to a device developed at MIT’s Computer
Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) that can monitor a
patient’s breathing, movement and sleep patterns using wireless signals.

Developed by MIT professor Dina Katabi and her research group at CSAIL, Emerald
is a WiFi-like box that analyzes the wireless signals in the environment using
artificial intelligence to infer people’s vital signs, sleep, and movement.
(The signals emit roughly 1000 times less radiation than a standard cellphone.)
