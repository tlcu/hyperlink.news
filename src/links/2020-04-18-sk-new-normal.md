The scene in Seoul on a picture-perfect Saturday contrasted sharply with other
nations where major cities look like ghost towns as governments lock down huge
swaths of the population or impose strict restrictions on social gatherings.

South Korea launched a massive testing and contact-tracing campaign that
significantly curtailed the outbreak and kept many businesses and factories
open. The number of new cases fell to 18 on Friday, the lowest since the
beginning of a surge in late February when the daily tally reached more than
900.

While both the U.S. and South Korea confirmed their first virus cases around
the same time in late January, the number of infections in the U.S. has swelled
to more than 700,000 while Korea “flattened the curve” last month and cases
have slowed to just over 10,000.
