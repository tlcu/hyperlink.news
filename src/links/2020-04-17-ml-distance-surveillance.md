## Machine learning could check if you’re social distancing properly at work

Andrew Ng’s startup Landing AI has created a new workplace monitoring tool that
issues an alert when anyone is less than the desired distance from a colleague.

The concept is not new. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Amazon is
also using similar software to monitor the distances between their warehouse
staff. The tool also joins a growing suite of technologies that companies are
increasingly using to surveil their workers. There are now myriad cheap
off-the-shelf AI systems that firms can buy to watch every employee in a store,
or listen to every customer service representative on a call. Like Landing AI’s
detector, these systems flag up warnings in real time when behaviors deviate
from a certain standard. The coronavirus pandemic has only accelerated this
trend.
