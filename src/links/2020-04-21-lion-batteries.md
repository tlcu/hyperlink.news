## To Understand the Medical Supply Shortage, It Helps to Know How the U.S. Lost the Lithium Ion Battery to China

The failed U.S. effort to dominate global production of the lithium ion battery
— which is key to energy independence, automobile innovation and more — holds
lessons for leaders grappling with the U.S.’s reliance on China for emergency
medical supplies.

With so many critical health care products now made offshore that supplies
could not meet surging demand as the coronavirus overwhelmed hospitals,
America’s attention has again turned to the atrophied state of domestic
manufacturing.

As imports from Chinese manufacturers vaporized and other countries clamped
down on exports, health care workers improvised with homemade face masks while
American factories retooled in a desperate race to make ventilators and
protective equipment. It’s a pattern, it seemed, in which devices invented in
the U.S. end up being produced overseas.

“Never again should we rely on the rest of the world for our essential
medicines and countermeasures,” vowed President Donald Trump’s trade adviser,
Peter Navarro, during a Coronavirus Task Force press briefing at the White
House. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo voiced similar frustration: “Long
term, we have to figure out why we wound up in this situation where we don’t
have the manufacturing capacity in this country.”
