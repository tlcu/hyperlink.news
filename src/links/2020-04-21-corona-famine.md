A report estimates that the number suffering from hunger could almost double
from 135m to more than 250m.

Those most at risk are in 10 countries affected by conflict, economic crisis
and climate change, the WFP says.

The fourth annual Global Report on Food Crises highlights Yemen, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan,
Syria, Nigeria and Haiti.

In South Sudan, 61% of the population was affected by food crisis last year,
the report says.

Even before the pandemic hit, parts of East Africa and South Asia were already
facing severe food shortages caused by drought and the worst locust
infestations for decades.
