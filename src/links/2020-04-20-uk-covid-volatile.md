Police forces in the UK have been told they must prepare for a "more volatile
and agitated society" after the country lifts its coronavirus lockdown.

After restrictions were extended until at least 7 May, there have been concerns
about the effects of unemployment, mental health issues, abuse inside homes and
a general need for "release", Chief Superintendent Paul Griffiths told The
Independent.

Meanwhile, the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance,
warned that vaccines are "long shots" and people should not rely on the swift
development of one to combat Covid-19, as a group of Oxford University
researchers said it will begin clinical trials next week.

There have been more than 2.4 million confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide,
and more than 165,000 people have died.
