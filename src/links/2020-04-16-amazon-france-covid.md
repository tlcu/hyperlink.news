Amazon has said it is unsure when it will re-open its distribution centres in
France. The company closed its warehouses after it was ordered to stop
deliveries of non-essential goods by a French court that ruled it had ignored
its obligation to protect the security and health of its employees during the
coronavirus pandemic.

On Thursday Amazon announced the closure of all its French centres for at least
5 days during which employees would be paid their full salaries.

The company has 6 warehouses in France employing 10,000 people and the EU head
of operations, Roy Perticucci, stepped down on Wednesday following the court
ruling.

Amazon Franceâ€™s biggest trade union, SUD, took the online retail giant to
court, alleging that workers were being forced to work in close proximity in
contravention of social-distancing measures.
