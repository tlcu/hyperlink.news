The team estimates that 56% of the general population must use the app to halt
the outbreak. Prof Fraser said that equated to 80% of all existing smartphone
owners, based on data from Ofcom.

"That's a very ambitious target," the professor acknowledged.

"It's not something that would typically happen for a new app - even an

intervention, that will be new and different.
