## Sanders says opposing Biden is ‘irresponsible’

He seemed to distance himself from his campaign’s former national press
secretary, Briahna Joy Gray, when asked about her recent statement on social
media refusing to endorse Biden.

“She is my former press secretary — not on the payroll,” Sanders noted. A
spokesman later clarified that all campaign staffers were no longer on the
payroll as of Tuesday, though they will get a severance check in May.

Sanders said his supporters have a simple choice now that Biden has emerged as
the presumptive nominee: “Do we be as active as we can in electing Joe Biden
and doing everything we can to move Joe and his campaign in a more progressive
direction? Or do we choose to sit it out and allow the most dangerous president
in modern American history to get reelected?”

He continued: “I believe that it’s irresponsible for anybody to say, ‘Well, I
disagree with Joe Biden -- I disagree with Joe Biden! -- and therefore I’m not
going to be involved.’”
