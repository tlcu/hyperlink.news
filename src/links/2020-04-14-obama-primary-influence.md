Over the past year, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former President Barack Obama
practiced a political distancing of sorts, with Mr. Obama maintaining a posture
of public neutrality in the Democratic primaries, offering counsel to any
candidate who called (most did), and Mr. Biden saying he wanted to win on his
own.

But with calibrated stealth, Mr. Obama has been considerably more engaged in
the campaign’s denouement than has been previously revealed.

Mr. Obama’s efforts to ease the senator out of the race played a significant role in his decision to end his bid and endorse Mr. Biden, according to people close to Mr. Sanders.
