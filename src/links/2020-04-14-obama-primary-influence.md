Over the past year, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former President Barack Obama
practiced a political distancing of sorts, with Mr. Obama maintaining a posture
of public neutrality in the Democratic primaries, offering counsel to any
candidate who called (most did), and Mr. Biden saying he wanted to win on his
own.

the campaign’s denouement than has been previously revealed.
