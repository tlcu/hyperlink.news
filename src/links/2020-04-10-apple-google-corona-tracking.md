## Apple and Google are building coronavirus tracking into iOS and Android

At first, the software will simply consist of an API (application programming
interface) that lets Apple and Android phones, which use distinct operating
systems, swap data with each other. Users will have to separately download apps
created by health authorities that use the API as the underlying system for
exchanging data. The data will be accessible to public health officials but
will not include information that is personally identifiable either to the
companies or to governments. Later on, the two firms plan to add contact
-tracing software directly into the operating systems, so that it will be on
more people’s phones by default.

Wide adoption will be necessary to make this an effective tool. Singapore’s
app, TraceTogether, which similarly uses Bluetooth to track the disease, was
adopted by 12% of the population. Health authorities will also need to create
apps that can use the API. Finally, the idea all still hinges on there being
widespread, rapid, reliable testing that lets people know they’re sick in the
first place.
