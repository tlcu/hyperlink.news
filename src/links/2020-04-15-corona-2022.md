## Coronavirus outbreaks projected to continue in waves: social distancing may be necessary into 2022

We projected that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably
occur after the initial, most severe pandemic wave. Absent other interventions,
a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care
capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social
distancing may be necessary into 2022. Additional interventions, including
expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the
success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity.
Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent
and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Even in the event of apparent
elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in
contagion could be possible as late as 2024.
