## Social distancing rule breakers, beware: Boston ‘vigilantes’ are reporting your violations

Pickup games of basketball. Co-workers enjoying lunch together. A child blowing
bubbles while strolling down the sidewalk with family.

A few weeks ago these were all harmless, heartwarming activities.

But in the age of coronavirus, they are drawing looks of disgust, shame on
social media, and a flood of complaints to police and local authorities, who
are fielding a surge of reports of supposed social distancing violations.

In fact, concern about the highly contagious virus has turned some area
residents into social distance vigilantes — cranky and over the top in some
cases, justifiably worried in others.

Some call city quality-of-life hot lines. Others dial 911. The most bold send
public tweets or Facebook messages to authorities, or surreptitiously snap
photos and videos and report them directly to police, demanding they clear
parks, halt soccer games, and disperse those they consider scofflaws.

“They probably won’t listen to you or me,” said Cambridge resident Cynthia
Haynes. “But if a police officer came out, a state trooper came out, they’d
probably leave.”
