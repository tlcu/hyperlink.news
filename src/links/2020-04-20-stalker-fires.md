Thrill-seekers inspired by a Soviet-era science fiction novel have been blamed
for wildfires near the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine.

Yaroslav Yemelyanenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian government, suspects that a
group of illegal visitors calling themselves “stalkers” were behind the blaze
in the exclusion zone set up around Chernobyl after its catastrophic meltdown
in the 1980s.

The stalkers are inspired by the pre-Chernobyl novel _Roadside Picnic_ by Arkady
and Boris Strugatsky, in which explorers enter a contaminated zone to recover
alien artefacts. The book gave rise to the film Stalker by Andrei Tarkovsky,
and a video game released in 2007 in which players hunt for artifacts in the
Chernobyl forbidden zone after a second nuclear accident.
