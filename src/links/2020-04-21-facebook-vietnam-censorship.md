Facebook’s local servers in Vietnam were taken offline early this year, slowing
local traffic to a crawl until it agreed to significantly increase the
censorship of “anti-state” posts for local users, two sources at the company
told Reuters on Tuesday.

The restrictions, which the sources said were carried out by state-owned
telecommunications companies, knocked the servers offline for around seven
weeks, meaning the website became unusable at times.

“We believe the action was taken to place significant pressure on us to
increase our compliance with legal takedown orders when it comes to content
that our users in Vietnam see,” the first of the two Facebook sources told
Reuters.

In an emailed statement, Facebook confirmed it had reluctantly complied with
the government’s request to “restrict access to content which it has deemed to
be illegal”.
