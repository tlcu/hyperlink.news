<p><time datetime=2020-04-23>23 / 4 / 2020</time> <em class='source'>Boston Dynamics</em></p>
<p>Starting in early March, Boston Dynamics started receiving inquiries from hospitals asking if our robots could help minimize their staff‚Äôs exposure to COVID-19. One of the hospitals that we spoke to shared that, within a week, a sixth of their staff had contracted COVID-19 and that they were looking into using robots to take more of their staff out of range of the novel virus.</p>
<figure>
<img src="spot-robot.jpg" title="Spot robot" alt="" /><figcaption>Spot robot</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Based on these conversations, as well as the global shortage of critical personal protective equipment (PPE), we have spent the past several weeks trying to better understand hospital requirements to develop a mobile robotics solution with our robot, Spot. The result is a legged robot application that can be deployed to support frontline staff responding to the pandemic in ad-hoc environments such as triage tents and parking lots.</p>
<p>Today marks the second week of Spot‚Äôs presence at a local Boston facility, Brigham and Women‚Äôs Hospital, where the medical team uses the robot as a mobile telemedicine platform, allowing healthcare providers to remotely triage patients. We‚Äôre listening to their feedback on how Spot can do more but are encouraged by reports that using the robot has helped their nursing staff minimize time exposed to potentially contagious patients.</p>

<h2 id="facebook-has-released-a-map-of-coronavirus-symptoms-crowdsourced-from-its-users">Facebook has released a map of coronavirus symptoms crowdsourced from its users</h2>
<p><time datetime=2020-04-21>21 / 4 / 2020</time> <em class='source'>MIT Technology Review</em></p>
<p>Facebook has released a map showing the proportion of people who say they have experienced coronavirus symptoms in each state in the US. The data was gathered from more than one million Facebook users who filled in a survey created by Carnegie Mellon University about whether they were experiencing symptoms like a cough or a fever. The map, which goes down to county level, will be updated every day. Facebook says it will create similar maps for other countries in the coming days and weeks, also based on survey responses.</p>
<figure>

<p>Obviously, the map is only as good as the data that‚Äôs used to create it, and as you can see for yourself, vast swaths of the map don‚Äôt have enough participants to yield reliable data. The map is part of Facebook‚Äôs work with CMU and the CDC to predict the coronavirus‚Äôs spread.</p>

<p><time datetime=2020-04-21>21 / 4 / 2020</time> <em class='source'>Reuters</em></p>
<p>Facebook‚Äôs local servers in Vietnam were taken offline early this year, slowing local traffic to a crawl until it agreed to significantly increase the censorship of ‚Äúanti-state‚Äù posts for local users, two sources at the company told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The restrictions, which the sources said were carried out by state-owned telecommunications companies, knocked the servers offline for around seven weeks, meaning the website became unusable at times.</p>
<p>‚ÄúWe believe the action was taken to place significant pressure on us to increase our compliance with legal takedown orders when it comes to content that our users in Vietnam see,‚Äù the first of the two Facebook sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>In an emailed statement, Facebook confirmed it had reluctantly complied with the government‚Äôs request to ‚Äúrestrict access to content which it has deemed to be illegal‚Äù.</p>

<p>A report estimates that the number suffering from hunger could almost double from 135m to more than 250m.</p>
<p>Those most at risk are in 10 countries affected by conflict, economic crisis and climate change, the WFP says.</p>
<p>The fourth annual Global Report on Food Crises highlights Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Nigeria and Haiti.</p>
<p>In South Sudan, 61% of the population was affected by food crisis last year, the report says.</p>
<p>Even before the pandemic hit, parts of East Africa and South Asia were already facing severe food shortages caused by drought and the worst locust infestations for decades.</p>

<p><time datetime=2020-04-20>20 / 4 / 2020</time> <em class='source'>The Independent</em></p>
<p>Police forces in the UK have been told they must prepare for a ‚Äúmore volatile and agitated society‚Äù after the country lifts its coronavirus lockdown.</p>
<p>After restrictions were extended until at least 7 May, there have been concerns about the effects of unemployment, mental health issues, abuse inside homes and a general need for ‚Äúrelease‚Äù, Chief Superintendent Paul Griffiths told The Independent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the government‚Äôs chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, warned that vaccines are ‚Äúlong shots‚Äù and people should not rely on the swift development of one to combat Covid-19, as a group of Oxford University researchers said it will begin clinical trials next week.</p>
<p>There have been more than 2.4 million confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, and more than 165,000 people have died.</p>

<p><time datetime=2020-04-20>20 / 4 / 2020</time> <em class='source'>The Times</em></p>
<p>Thrill-seekers inspired by a Soviet-era science fiction novel have been blamed for wildfires near the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine.</p>
<p><img src="stalker-fires.jpg" title="The wildfires near the Chernobyl nuclear plant spread to the capital city Kiev - VOLODYMYR SHUVAYEV/REUTERS" /></p>
<p>Yaroslav Yemelyanenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian government, suspects that a group of illegal visitors calling themselves ‚Äústalkers‚Äù were behind the blaze in the exclusion zone set up around Chernobyl after its catastrophic meltdown in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The stalkers are inspired by the pre-Chernobyl novel <em>Roadside Picnic</em> by Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, in which explorers enter a contaminated zone to recover alien artefacts. The book gave rise to the film Stalker by Andrei Tarkovsky, and a video game released in 2007 in which players hunt for artifacts in the Chernobyl forbidden zone after a second nuclear accident.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has warned that China should face consequences if it was ‚Äúknowingly responsible‚Äù for the coronavirus pandemic, as deaths in Europe from Covid-19 approached 100,000.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIt could have been stopped in China before it started and it wasn‚Äôt, and the whole world is suffering because of it,‚Äù Trump said in his daily White House briefing, as US cases topped 730,000 and fatalities in the country approached 39,000.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIf it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake. But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, I mean, then sure there should be consequences,‚Äù Trump said. He did not elaborate on what form that might take.</p>
<p>He said the Chinese were ‚Äúembarrassed‚Äù and the question now was whether what happened with the coronavirus was ‚Äúa mistake that got out of control, or was it done deliberately?‚Äù</p>
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a big difference between those two,‚Äù he said.

<p>Twitter Inc will not be able to reveal surveillance requests it received from the U.S. government after a federal judge accepted government arguments that this was likely to harm national security after a near six-year long legal battle.</p>
<p><img style='display: block; margin: 1ex auto;' src=twitter-bird.png alt='Twitter logo' height=100 /></p>
<p>The social media company had sued the U.S. Department of Justice in 2014 to be allowed to reveal, as part of its ‚ÄúDraft Transparency Report‚Äù, the surveillance requests it received. It argued its free-speech rights were being violated by not being allowed to reveal the details.</p>
<p>The judge ruled on Friday that granting Twitter‚Äôs request ‚Äúwould be likely to lead to grave or imminent harm to the national security.‚Äù</p>

<p><time datetime=2020-04-18>18 / 4 / 2020</time> <em class='source'>Bloomberg</em></p>
<p>The scene in Seoul on a picture-perfect Saturday contrasted sharply with other nations where major cities look like ghost towns as governments lock down huge swaths of the population or impose strict restrictions on social gatherings.</p>
<p><img src="garosu-gil.jpg" title="People sit at a cafe in the Garosu-gil neighborhood of the Gangnam district of Seoul, April 18. Photographer: SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg" /></p>
<p>South Korea launched a massive testing and contact-tracing campaign that significantly curtailed the outbreak and kept many businesses and factories open. The number of new cases fell to 18 on Friday, the lowest since the beginning of a surge in late February when the daily tally reached more than 900.</p>
<p>While both the U.S. and South Korea confirmed their first virus cases around the same time in late January, the number of infections in the U.S. has swelled to more than 700,000 while Korea ‚Äúflattened the curve‚Äù last month and cases have slowed to just over 10,000.</p>

<p>While the unrest so far has only involved a relatively small number of people in states including Minnesota, Michigan, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and Florida, it comes as the US president has raised expectations for a lifting of restrictions while the US death toll from the pandemic nears 35,000.</p>
<p><img src="plandemic.webp" title="Protesters, like these in Florida, argue that restrictions meant to stop the pandemic are violating their civil rights ¬© AP" /></p>
<p>Mr Trump took to Twitter to support the protests on Friday, a day after he backed away from claims that he had ‚Äútotal‚Äù authority to reopen the economy and said state governors should make such decisions, based on his guidelines.</p>
<p>‚ÄúLIBERATE MINNESOTA,‚Äù he wrote, before adding, ‚ÄúLIBERATE MICHIGAN‚Äù, referring in both cases to Midwestern states where protesters have taken aim at restrictions ordered by Democratic governors.</p>

<p>‚ÄúThis is mayhem,‚Äù New York Gov.¬†Andrew Cuomo said Friday. ‚ÄúWe need a coordinated approach between the federal government and the states.‚Äù</p>
<p>In the absence of one, Cuomo and sixteen other governors representing half the nation‚Äôs population have organized three separate clusters of states each committed to working together on the details of relaunching businesses, schools and events while avoiding a resurgence of infections.</p>
<p>The pacts have formed among states mostly with Democratic governors on the West Coast, around the Great Lakes and in the densely populated Northeast, covering several big metropolitan areas that cross state lines, including New York, Chicago and Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Others are going their own way, including the second most populous state ‚Äî Texas ‚Äî where Gov.¬†Greg Abbott said Friday that he would ease some pandemic-related restrictions next week. Florida, another state with a huge population, is also not in an alliance.</p>
<p>California, Oregon and Washington state have teamed up, and pacts have formed among Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island as well as Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio and Wisconsin.</p>

City officials told the newspaper they followed in the footsteps of other cities, and filled the skatepark with 37 tons of sand.</p>
<p>The nonprofit group that has raised money to support the skatepark, however, says the city made the decision to fill the skatepark with sand without notifying them first.</p>

<p>The concept is not new. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Amazon is also using similar software to monitor the distances between their warehouse staff. The tool also joins a growing suite of technologies that companies are increasingly using to surveil their workers. There are now myriad cheap off-the-shelf AI systems that firms can buy to watch every employee in a store, or listen to every customer service representative on a call. Like Landing AI‚Äôs detector, these systems flag up warnings in real time when behaviors deviate from a certain standard. The coronavirus pandemic has only accelerated this trend.</p>

<p><time datetime=2020-04-14> 14 / 4 / 2020</time> <em class='source'>Science</em></p>
<p>We projected that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after the initial, most severe pandemic wave. Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022. Additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity. Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.</p>

<p>‚ÄúIt is very likely that this year the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago,‚Äù IMF Economic Counsellor Gita Gopinath wrote in the report. ‚ÄúThe Great Lockdown, as one might call it, is projected to shrink global growth dramatically.‚Äù</p>

<p><time datetime=2020-04-14>14 / 4 / 2020</time> <em class='source'>MIT CSAIL</em></p>
<p>This week a clinical team in Boston has reported being able to monitor a COVID-19 patient remotely, thanks to a device developed at MIT‚Äôs Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) that can monitor a patient‚Äôs breathing, movement and sleep patterns using wireless signals.</p>
<p><img src="covid-breathing.gif" title="Breathing data visualization" /></p>
<p>Developed by MIT professor Dina Katabi and her research group at CSAIL, Emerald is a WiFi-like box that analyzes the wireless signals in the environment using artificial intelligence to infer people‚Äôs vital signs, sleep, and movement. (The signals emit roughly 1000 times less radiation than a standard cellphone.)</p>

<p>Global demand for crude is normally around 100 million barrels a day. Estimates of the decline vary widely and change daily, but most put current demand at 65 million to 80 million barrels a day. In volume and percentage, the fall exceeds the collapse of 1979 to 1983. It occurred over four weeks, not four years.</p>

<p>‚ÄúSince humans started using oil, we have never seen anything like this,‚Äù said Saad Rahim, chief economist at Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd., a Singapore commodity-trading company that estimates demand at 65 million to 70 million barrels a day. ‚ÄúThere is no guide we are following. This is uncharted.‚Äù</p>

<p>Baishazhou market, the biggest wholesale wet market in Wuhan, is buzzing again this week after the city‚Äôs lockdown was lifted on April 8. All those entering the market must have their temperatures tested and show market inspectors their green code, which suggests the user is symptom-free.</p>

<p>The market stayed open during the past two months, striving to keep normal operation of the city, which was struggling with the coronavirus. ‚ÄúIf Baishazhou were closed, there would be no food for Wuhan people,‚Äù manager of the market, surnamed Zheng, told the Global Times.</p>

<p>Labour party officials opposed to Jeremy Corbyn worked to lose the 2017 general election in the hope that a bad result would trigger a leadership contest to oust him, a dossier drawn up by the party suggests.</p>

<p>A huge cache of leaked WhatsApp messages and emails show senior officials from the party‚Äôs right wing, who worked at its HQ, became despondent as Labour climbed in the polls during the election campaign despite their efforts.</p>

<h2 id="apple-and-google-are-building-coronavirus-tracking-into-ios-and-android">Apple and Google are building coronavirus tracking into iOS and Android</h2>
<p><time datetime=2020-04-10>10 / 4 / 2020</time> <em class='source'>MIT Technology Review</em></p>
<p>At first, the software will simply consist of an API (application programming interface) that lets Apple and Android phones, which use distinct operating systems, swap data with each other. Users will have to separately download apps created by health authorities that use the API as the underlying system for exchanging data. The data will be accessible to public health officials but will not include information that is personally identifiable either to the companies or to governments. Later on, the two firms plan to add contact -tracing software directly into the operating systems, so that it will be on more people‚Äôs phones by default.</p>
<p>Wide adoption will be necessary to make this an effective tool. Singapore‚Äôs app, TraceTogether, which similarly uses Bluetooth to track the disease, was adopted by 12% of the population. Health authorities will also need to create apps that can use the API. Finally, the idea all still hinges on there being widespread, rapid, reliable testing that lets people know they‚Äôre sick in the first place.</p>

<p><time datetime=2020-01-28>28 / 1 / 2020</time> <em class='source'>The Web Conference, 2020</em></p>
<p>Targeted online advertising has become an inextricable part of the way Web content and applications are monetized. At the beginning, online advertising consisted of simple ad-banners broadly shown to website visitors. Over time, it evolved into a complex ecosystem that tracks and collects a wealth of data to learn user habits and show targeted and personalized ads. To protect users against tracking, several countermeasures have been proposed, ranging from browser extensions that leverage filter lists, to features natively integrated into popular browsers like Firefox and Brave to combat more modern techniques like browser fingerprinting. Nevertheless, few browsers offer protections against IP address-based tracking techniques. Notably, the most popular browsers, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge do not offer any.</p>

<p><time datetime=2020-01-26>26 / 1 / 2020</time> <em class='source'>NECSI</em></p>
<p>The novel coronavirus emerging out of Wuhan, China has been identified as a deadly strain that is also highly contagious. The response by China to date has included travel restrictions on tens of millions across several major cities in an effort to slow its spread. Despite this, positively identified cases have already been detected in many countries spanning the globe and there are doubts such containment would be effective. This note outlines some principles to bear in relation to such a process.</p>
<p><img src="doctors-whuan.png" title="Whuan doctors" /></p>
<p>Clearly, we are dealing with an extreme fat-tailed process owing to an increased connectivity, which increases the spreading in a nonlinear way. Fat tailed processes have special attributes, making conventional risk-management approaches inadequate.</p>
