<h2 id="coronavirus-nhs-contact-tracing-app-to-target-80-of-smartphone-users">Coronavirus: NHS contact tracing app to target 80% of smartphone users</h2>
<p><time datetime=2020-04-16>16 / 4 / 2020</time> <em>BBC News</em></p>
<p>The team estimates that 56% of the general population must use the app to halt the outbreak. Prof Fraser said that equated to 80% of all existing smartphone owners, based on data from Ofcom.</p>
<p>“That’s a very ambitious target,” the professor acknowledged.</p>
<p>"It’s not something that would typically happen for a new app - even an incredibly popular one - but if we can explain that this is a public health intervention, that will be new and different.</p>

<h2 id="sanders-says-opposing-biden-is-irresponsible">Sanders says opposing Biden is ‘irresponsible’</h2>
<p><time datetime=2020-04-15>15 / 4 / 2020</time> <em>Associated Press</em></p>
<p>He seemed to distance himself from his campaign’s former national press secretary, Briahna Joy Gray, when asked about her recent statement on social media refusing to endorse Biden.</p>
<p>“She is my former press secretary — not on the payroll,” Sanders noted. A spokesman later clarified that all campaign staffers were no longer on the payroll as of Tuesday, though they will get a severance check in May.</p>
<p>Sanders said his supporters have a simple choice now that Biden has emerged as the presumptive nominee: “Do we be as active as we can in electing Joe Biden and doing everything we can to move Joe and his campaign in a more progressive direction? Or do we choose to sit it out and allow the most dangerous president in modern American history to get reelected?”</p>
<p>He continued: “I believe that it’s irresponsible for anybody to say, ‘Well, I disagree with Joe Biden – I disagree with Joe Biden! – and therefore I’m not going to be involved.’”</p>

<h2 id="coronavirus-outbreaks-projected-to-continue-in-waves-social-distancing-may-be-necessary-into-2022">Coronavirus outbreaks projected to continue in waves: social distancing may be necessary into 2022</h2>
<p><time datetime=2020-04-14> 14 / 4 / 2020</time> <em>Science</em></p>
<p>We projected that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after the initial, most severe pandemic wave. Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022. Additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity. Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024.</p>

<h2 id="accelerate-the-endgame-obamas-role-in-wrapping-up-the-primary">‘Accelerate the Endgame’: <br> Obama’s Role in Wrapping Up the Primary</h2>
<p><time datetime=2020-04-14>14 / 4 / 2020</time> <em>The New York Times</em></p>
<p>Over the past year, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former President Barack Obama practiced a political distancing of sorts, with Mr. Obama maintaining a posture of public neutrality in the Democratic primaries, offering counsel to any candidate who called (most did), and Mr. Biden saying he wanted to win on his own.</p>
<p>But with calibrated stealth, Mr. Obama has been considerably more engaged in the campaign’s denouement than has been previously revealed.</p>

<p><time datetime=2020-04-14>14 / 4 / 2020</time> <em>Politico</em></p>
<p>The global economy is expected to contract by 3 percent in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Monetary Fund predicted in its annual World Economic Outlook released Tuesday.</p>
<p>“It is very likely that this year the global economy will experience its worst recession since the Great Depression, surpassing that seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago,” IMF Economic Counsellor Gita Gopinath wrote in the report. “The Great Lockdown, as one might call it, is projected to shrink global growth dramatically.”</p>

<h2 id="csail-device-lets-doctors-monitor-covid-19-patients-from-a-distance">CSAIL device lets doctors monitor COVID-19 patients from a distance</h2>
<p><time datetime=2020-04-14>14 / 4 / 2020</time> <em>MIT CSAIL</em></p>
<p>This week a clinical team in Boston has reported being able to monitor a COVID-19 patient remotely, thanks to a device developed at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) that can monitor a patient’s breathing, movement and sleep patterns using wireless signals.</p>
<p><img src="covid-breathing.gif" title="Breathing data visualization" /></p>
<p>Developed by MIT professor Dina Katabi and her research group at CSAIL, Emerald is a WiFi-like box that analyzes the wireless signals in the environment using artificial intelligence to infer people’s vital signs, sleep, and movement. (The signals emit roughly 1000 times less radiation than a standard cellphone.)</p>

<p><time datetime=2020-04-14>14 / 4 / 2020</time> <em>The Wall Street Journal</em></p>
<p>Global demand for crude is normally around 100 million barrels a day. Estimates of the decline vary widely and change daily, but most put current demand at 65 million to 80 million barrels a day. In volume and percentage, the fall exceeds the collapse of 1979 to 1983. It occurred over four weeks, not four years.</p>
<p><img src="corona-empty-streets.jpg" title="Empty highways" /></p>
<p>“Since humans started using oil, we have never seen anything like this,” said Saad Rahim, chief economist at Trafigura Group Pte. Ltd., a Singapore commodity-trading company that estimates demand at 65 million to 70 million barrels a day. “There is no guide we are following. This is uncharted.”</p>

<p>Baishazhou market, the biggest wholesale wet market in Wuhan, is buzzing again this week after the city’s lockdown was lifted on April 8. All those entering the market must have their temperatures tested and show market inspectors their green code, which suggests the user is symptom-free.</p>

<p>The market stayed open during the past two months, striving to keep normal operation of the city, which was struggling with the coronavirus. “If Baishazhou were closed, there would be no food for Wuhan people,” manager of the market, surnamed Zheng, told the Global Times.</p>

<p><time datetime=2020-04-13>13 / 4 / 2020</time> <em>The Independent</em></p>
<p>Labour party officials opposed to Jeremy Corbyn worked to lose the 2017 general election in the hope that a bad result would trigger a leadership contest to oust him, a dossier drawn up by the party suggests.</p>
<p><img src="corybn.jpg" title="Jeremy Corbyn" /></p>
<p>A huge cache of leaked WhatsApp messages and emails show senior officials from the party’s right wing, who worked at its HQ, became despondent as Labour climbed in the polls during the election campaign despite their efforts.</p>

<h2 id="apple-and-google-are-building-coronavirus-tracking-into-ios-and-android">Apple and Google are building coronavirus tracking into iOS and Android</h2>
<p><time datetime=2020-04-10>10 / 4 / 2020</time> <em>MIT Technology Review</em></p>
<p>At first, the software will simply consist of an API (application programming interface) that lets Apple and Android phones, which use distinct operating systems, swap data with each other. Users will have to separately download apps created by health authorities that use the API as the underlying system for exchanging data. The data will be accessible to public health officials but will not include information that is personally identifiable either to the companies or to governments. Later on, the two firms plan to add contact -tracing software directly into the operating systems, so that it will be on more people’s phones by default.</p>
<p>Wide adoption will be necessary to make this an effective tool. Singapore’s app, TraceTogether, which similarly uses Bluetooth to track the disease, was adopted by 12% of the population. Health authorities will also need to create apps that can use the API. Finally, the idea all still hinges on there being widespread, rapid, reliable testing that lets people know they’re sick in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="dont-count-me-out-on-the-relevance-of-ip-addresses-in-the-tracking-ecosystem">Don’t count me out: On the relevance of IP addresses in the tracking ecosystem</h2>
<p><time datetime=2020-01-28>28 / 1 / 2020</time> <em>The Web Conference, 2020</em></p>
<p>Targeted online advertising has become an inextricable part of the way Web content and applications are monetized. At the beginning, online advertising consisted of simple ad-banners broadly shown to website visitors. Over time, it evolved into a complex ecosystem that tracks and collects a wealth of data to learn user habits and show targeted and personalized ads. To protect users against tracking, several countermeasures have been proposed, ranging from browser extensions that leverage filter lists, to features natively integrated into popular browsers like Firefox and Brave to combat more modern techniques like browser fingerprinting. Nevertheless, few browsers offer protections against IP address-based tracking techniques. Notably, the most popular browsers, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge do not offer any.</p>

<h2 id="systemic-risk-of-pandemic-via-novel-pathogens-coronavirus-a-note">Systemic Risk of Pandemic via Novel Pathogens – Coronavirus: A Note</h2>
<p><time datetime=2020-01-26>26 / 1 / 2020</time> <em>New England Complex Systems Institute</em></p>
<p>The novel coronavirus emerging out of Wuhan, China has been identified as a deadly strain that is also highly contagious. The response by China to date has included travel restrictions on tens of millions across several major cities in an effort to slow its spread. Despite this, positively identified cases have already been detected in many countries spanning the globe and there are doubts such containment would be effective. This note outlines some principles to bear in relation to such a process.</p>
<p><img src="doctors-whuan.png" title="Whuan doctors" /></p>
<p>Clearly, we are dealing with an extreme fat-tailed process owing to an increased connectivity, which increases the spreading in a nonlinear way. Fat tailed processes have special attributes, making conventional risk-management approaches inadequate.</p>
